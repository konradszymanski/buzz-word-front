# BuzzWords Readme

Generation UK 2020-2021.
All the project team are [collaborators] on the repository. 

 - [x] Product backlog items go in here

## Description
Buzzwords is Multiplayer game for large groups - We created the game from scratch, with a Vanilla JS Front end, and a Node/Express/MongoDb back end./
The game was written with two Agile teams . Hosted on GIT, and set up to deploy automatically with Heroku on each push./
On our graduation day we played the game with 15 players across the Internet.

## My role within a team

I was on the Front-End Team and contributed the honeycomb layout which is generated by JavaScript./
We used to work on the other visual elements, such us structure the game, fonts, colors, onclick effects etc. /
For example all the buttons are styled by myself. /

### Updates

Although the online sessions are over, and Buzz-Word Game was a final project, I would like to support this game alone by adding more Front-End improvements to make this game more UI and UX friendly.
